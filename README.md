# The Pragmatic Engineer

## Chapter 1 - The Pragmatic Philosophy

What distinguishes Pragmatic Programmers? We feel it’s an attitude, a style, a philosophy of approaching problems and their solutions. They think beyond the immediate problem, placing it in its larger context and seeking out the bigger picture. After all, without this larger context, how can you be pragmatic? How can you make intelligent compromises and informed decisions?

1. We can be proud of our abilities, but we must own up to our shortcomings—our ignorance and our mistakes
2. Don't be afraid to admit ignorance or error or mistakes. Try to offer solutions
3. Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses
4. Think! About Your Work. Constantly be thinking, critiquing your work in real time
5. Care About Your Craft
6. When you find yourself saying, “I don’t know,” be sure to follow it up with “—but I’ll find out.”
7. Don’t leave “broken windows’’ (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered. If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then board it up. Neglect accelerates software rot faster than any other factor.
8. Like the soldiers in "The Stone Soup Story", be a catalyst for change. However, be as objective as you can be when you try to catalyze a change.
9. Constantly review what’s happening around you, not just what you personally are doing. Remember the big picture.
10. Let your users and stakeholders participate in deciding what is good enough software. Great software today is often preferable to the fantasy of perfect software tomorrow. If you give your users something to play with early, their feedback will often lead you to a better eventual solution.
11. Don’t spoil a perfectly good program by overembellishment and overrefinement. Move on, and let your code stand in its own right for a while. It may not be perfect. Don’t worry: it could never be perfect.

> An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest - Benjamin Franklin

13. Your knowledge and experience are your most important day-to-day professional assets. Unfortunately, they’re expiring assets
14. Your ability to learn new things is your most important strategic asset
15. Your knowledge portfolio is all the facts you know in computing, the application domain you work in, and all your experience.
16. Building Your Knowledge Portfolio:
    - Invest regularly - Just as in financial investing, you must invest in your knowledge portfolio regularly, even if it’s just a small amount.
    - Diversify - The more different things you know, the more valuable you are. As a baseline, you need to know the ins and outs of the particular technology you are working with currently. But don’t stop there. And don't forget the non-technical areas.
    - Manage risk - Technology exists along a spectrum from risky, potentially high-reward to low-risk, low-reward standards. Don’t put all your technical eggs in one basket.
    - Buy low, sell high - Learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock, but the payoff can be just as rewarding
    - Review and rebalance - This is a very dynamic industry. That hot technology you started investigating last month might be stone cold by now.

    > The most important of all is - __Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio__

17. Some suggestions on how to go about acquiring knowledge
    - Learn a new language each year
    - Read a technical book each month
    - Read non-technical books too
    - Take classes - online or offline
    - Participate in local user groups and meetups - be active in these groups
    - Experiment with different environments - Windows, Linux, vim etc.
    - Stay current by reading news and posts online on different technology
18. When someone asks you something you have no idea what it is, take it as a challenge, don't rest until you find the answer.
19. Time spent waiting for doctors and dentists can be a great opportunity to catch up on your reading - but be sure to bring your own e-reader with you, or you might find yourself thumbing through a dog eared 1973 article about Papua New Guinea
20. Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear. Beware of zealots who insists there dogma is the only way to go. Beware of commercialism, the first hit from your web search is not neccessarily the best result, someone could have paid to put it there.

> A good idea is an orphan without effective communication.

21. Know your Audience
22. You’re communicating only if you’re conveying what you mean to convey—just talking isn’t enough. To do that, you need to understand the needs, interests, and capabilities of your audience.
23. Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Refine it until it commmunicates exactly what you want to say to your audience
24.
